# RFSwitchControlViaSampleFile
Control Mini-Circuits RF switch via a config file

This is to control a mini-circuits F switch though the use of a config.sample file. 
All three files are needed to run and must be in the same folder. 
The RFControl script contains the function to talk to the switch. 
The runFromConfSam script pulls the RF control file, loads the setting information from config.sample, and has a list of preset switch configurations. 
The config.sample file selects which predetermined path to use in the runFromConfSam script.
